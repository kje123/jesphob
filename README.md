If you've stumbled upon this, congrats! You have found this earlier than intended. This project is currently in the prototyping phase, so I do not recommend using this until I have done an official release, and I cannot help you if weird issues pop up.

If you wanna ask my questions or get involved, you can find me on Discord. My username is .kje
